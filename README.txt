This site was built using HTML and JavaScript and styled with CSS. 

It is the beginning stages of my case study project, LocoManage, which is an online tool for model train enthusiasts to track their collection using a database. There is some functionality that I am having trouble implementing (sorting) but it does not affect the user's current view of the site.

-Renamed some files
-Today in class we talked about repositories, but I feel more comfortable with my existing services classes, so I think I'm sticking with those. 
-I need to write my user stories and wireframe my front end. I have some ideas, but nothing concrete yet.
