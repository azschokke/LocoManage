LocoManage is an easy-to use web application for model railroaders to view their collection (including some sorting functionality) and model their layout.

CHALLENGES
The design phase, and sticking to one design, was difficult for me. It felt like every time I had made a decision on how I wanted to structure everything, I thought of a different way to do it that seemed preferable. 
- This was a matter of realizing I had a deadline to stick to and making a decision. 

Coming into this course, I was already familiar with Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and had experience with Servlets in Java as well as SQL, so I decided to learn React for this project since it seems like a skill that is currently in demand. 
-There was a bit of a learning curve using a completely new tool, but knowing the base language and reading the documentation helped, and I definitely learned a lot. I found quirks along the way that were frustrating until I found the solution. I've found debugging JavaScript to be an entirely different beast from debugging Java. 

REST API
-Per the definitions of a REST API I found online, mine does not technically qualify as a "REST API", but what I have handles Cross-Origin requests and returns back Strings representing Json objects to the front end. This was not something we covered in class, but since I started building with React, I had to figure out how to create a REST API (or some approximation) for my project to function.
